# Consulting

I offer consulting for companies and organizations looking to explore and apply artificial intelligence in their daily operations.

With a background in **data science, machine learning, and AI research**, I bring both academic expertise and hands-on experience in building scalable AI solutions.  

Whether you need help with:
- Understanding how AI can support your business processes  
- Exploring opportunities for automation and optimization  
- Designing and implementing custom machine learning workflows  
- Translating complex AI concepts into clear, actionable strategies  

…I can provide guidance tailored to your goals.  

If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out — I’d be happy to discuss how AI can bring value to your work.
