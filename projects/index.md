# Projects

## [Deep Neural Network in C with 2 layers](https://github.com/thomkell/DeepNeuralNetwork)
A deep neural network implementation in C, designed with a focus on parallelizing the training process. This project demonstrates the use of parallel computing techniques to enhance the efficiency and speed of neural network training using OpenMP and CUDA.

## [COPD Severity Staging using U-net](https://github.com/thomkell/COPD-Severity-Staging)
This project utilizes the U-Net architecture to stage the severity of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) based on medical imaging data. The U-Net model is used for precise image segmentation, aiding in the automated classification of COPD severity, which can be crucial for clinical decision-making.

## [Perona Malik with Mimetic Method](https://github.com/thomkell/PeronaMalikwithMimeticMethod)
An implementation of the Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion model using the Mimetic Method. This project primarily focuses on denoising in image processing, enhancing image quality while maintaining important structural features.
