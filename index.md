## Welcome to My Site

Hi, I’m Thomas - an AI Researcher specializing in medical imaging and digital pathology. With a background in computational science and data science, I develop scalable AI solutions that support diagnostics and improve healthcare outcomes.

Previously, I worked as an AI Research Engineer at the Ellison Medical Institute in Los Angeles, where I built machine learning workflows, optimized AI pipelines, and applied foundation models to complex pathology datasets. Earlier projects include deep learning for COPD severity staging and parallelized neural networks for efficient prediction.

I am now beginning my PhD in artificial intelligence and medical imaging, continuing my focus on advancing AI-driven approaches for healthcare. In my free time, I explore ways to bring AI into companies’ daily operations, making advanced technologies more accessible and impactful beyond research.

I’m passionate about tackling meaningful challenges through AI and enjoy collaborating in innovative, interdisciplinary environments to translate research into real-world impact.
