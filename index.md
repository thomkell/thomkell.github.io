## Welcome to My Site

Hi, I’m Thomas, a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and AI Researcher specializing in medical imaging AI and digital pathology. With a strong background in computational science and data science, I work on developing scalable AI solutions to improve diagnostics and enhance patient care.

Currently, I focus on building machine learning workflows, developing models, and optimizing AI pipelines for digital pathology at the Ellison Medical Institute. My work includes leveraging vector-based machine learning, cloud computing, and advanced data processing techniques to analyze complex medical datasets and deliver impactful, scalable solutions. Previously, I worked on projects such as COPD severity staging using deep learning and parallelizing neural networks for faster and more efficient predictions.

I’m passionate about solving meaningful challenges in healthcare and beyond through AI and enjoy collaborating in dynamic, innovative environments to drive progress.
